## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to use the `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` hooks in a React component.

The component defined in `src/components/ExampleComponent.js` has two props: `propA` and `propB`. The component displays the values of these props and the result of two calculations: `propA + propB` and `propA * 2`.

The `useEffect` hook is used to simulate an API call and update the component's state after a delay. The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of `propA * 2`, which is expensive to compute. The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize a function that is passed as a prop to a child component, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
